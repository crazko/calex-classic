A browser extension that shows events' descriptions in Google Calendar.

**Note:** In October 2017 Google [launched new version](https://9to5google.com/2017/10/17/google-calendar-web-material-design-update/) of Calendar, which this extension isn't compatible with, but still works with older "Classic" Calendar as long as it is available. [New version](https://github.com/crazko/calex-material) of the extension is under development.
